Simple Xml parser for .NET Micro Framework (made for Netduino)

I noticed that the .NET Microframework that's used on Netduinos does not support System.Xml, but I wanted to use Xml in my Netduino projects, so I wrote this simple parser.
It's very barebones (code size and memory usage are always a concern on the Micro Framework). It supports elements and attributes. NO namespaces or more esoteric features.
